# csc_webapp
This is a web application developed for my Computing Science in the classroom course in order to show an example of a basic web app working. The application shows a proof-of-concept credentials evaluation by calculating a score from a username and password based on diversity of characters used, password length and repetion between and within the username and password. The code is structured with the purpose of being readable by a wide audience including students from S3 and above.
